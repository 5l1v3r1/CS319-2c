<h3> Dribble and Score! </h3>

"Dribble and Score" is a game that combines two mini-games inside it. First the player will try to dribble towards the goal while incoming enemies from defenders to lawnmowers will annoy him. The player has to jump, crouch or go left or right to eliminate them, but he is not completely alone: the spikes, knee pads and fans will occur as bonuses in his tough way to the score.  If the player successes so far, then he will face against a challenging goal keeper, and he has to score.

There are examples of both road-running and scoring games, but we have never encountered a game that combines that two like us. The first part of game, the gameplay will be like <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imangi.templerun&hl=en"> Temple Run </a> or <a href= "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&hl=en" >Subway Surfers </a> but with soccer theme: enemies will be football-related, the playgrounds will look like football stadiums and so on. For the second part of the game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mobilecraft.football&hl=en"> Flick Shoot </a> is a game we take as an example, however the shooting is planned to be always from penalty spot in our game. There will be bunches of levels, getting harder one by one, for both parts of the game.

The game will be implemented in Java, for Desktop environment.
