<h3> Dribble and Score! </h3>

"Dribble and Score" is a game that combines two mini-games inside it. First the player will try to dribble towards the goal while incoming enemies from defenders to lawnmowers will annoy him. If the player successes so far, then he will face against a tough goal keeper, and he has to score.

There are examples of both road-running and scoring games, but we never encountered a game that combines that two like us. The first part of game, the gameplay be like <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imangi.templerun&hl=en"> Temple Run </a> or <a href= "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&hl=en" >Subway Surfers </a> but with soccer theme: enemies will be football-related, the playgrounds will look like football stadiums and so on. For the second part of the game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mobilecraft.football&hl=en"> Flick Shoot </a> is a game we take example, however the shooting is planned to be always from penalty spot in our game. There will be bunches of levels, getting harder one by one, for both parts of the game.

The game will be implemented in Java, for Desktop environment.
